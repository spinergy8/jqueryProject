This is my webpage for the Turtle and Rabbit race game...or The Race of the Century!

I have worked on it for awhile and while it is not the most complicated or fanciest - I added to it and created what my ever
changing vision was!

I had help from a co-worker to get the secondary fadeTo to work correctly, I was right at the cusp of getting it, my code was
just about correct.  The initial instance of fadeTo, I got working ALL ON MY OWN!
